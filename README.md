  - [`~/.config/neomutt/themes/spacechalk/powerline.neomuttrc`](.config/neomutt/themes/spacechalk/powerline.neomuttrc)

  Config files for [NeoMutt], a terminal based email client. Config includes:
  - sets spacechalk theme, based on the [neonwolf colorscheme] and [neomutt powerline]
  - sets character set to be utf-8 (emojis üßë‚Äçüíª)
  - sets basic SMTP settings (but use [offlineimap] to pull the imap backup)
  - sets tls by default

  - sets navigation keys similar to vim
  - set a key binding for `V` to be opening html attachments
  - removes the prompt of hitting enter after viewing an attachment

  You'll still need to create `~/.config/neomutt/keys` with the following info:

  ```ini
  set my_user=you@youremail.com
  set my_name="Your Name"

  # if you're using protonmail this is the password from protonmail-bridge,
  # after you login, not your actual email password
  set my_pass="areallycoolpasswordfordogs"
  ```

  Config file for [NeoMutt's MIME Support], which is how [NeoMutt], a [TUI]
  email client, handles attachments e.g. html in an email body, PDFs, images...

  We currently open these applications for these file types:

  | file type | application   |
  |:---------:|---------------|
  |    html   | [w3m]         |
  |    PDFs   | macOS preview |
  |   images  | img2[sixel]   |

    <summary><code>nvim</code></summary>

  <blockquote>

  Config files for [neovim] is a hyperextensible Vim-based text editor,
  which is in some ways a sucessor to [vim]. It's a lot faster, for one,
  and there's more support for more languages, which means more plugins.
  Uses [packer] to manager neovim plugins.

  Each file explained below:

  ### [`init.lua`](.config/nvim/init.lua)
  The main global configuration changes are:
  - turning off mouse scrolling
  - enabling line numbers
  - adding a cursorline
  - case insensitive searches
  - setting column 80 to be a different color for tidy code
  - enabling gui colors so you aren't limited to like 8 colors
  - uses the [spacechalk.nvim] colorscheme
  - sources all the files in [~/.config/nvim/lua](.config/nvim/lua),
    including [packer], plugins, and local plugin configs.

  ### [`~/.config/nvim/packerinit.vim`](.config/nvim/packerinit.vim)
  This is a quick and dirty lua function to print " ‚ô• ‚ô• ‚ô• " if neovim is running
  in an interactive session and packer completes an action, and to exit if we're
  running headless, meaning we're running in a script.

  ### [`~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins.lua`](.config/nvim/lua/plugins.lua)
  This is the configuration for packer, our plugin manager for neovim. It
  installs packer, and then all of our plugins. You can check out all the
  plugins that are installed, or called from vim plugins starting on line 15.

  ### [`~/.config/nvim/lua/user/dashboard.lua`](.config/nvim/lua/user/dashboard.lua)
  config for a starting screen [dashboard] for neovim. You
  should just check out the file to see what's being done. It's cute ascii art,
  and utilizes [telescope] to check out your files and previously
  opened files.

  ### [`~/.config/nvim/lua/user/folding.lua`](.config/nvim/lua/user/folding.lua)
  config file to enable folding, which is just vim speak for collapsing
  blocks of code. Sets some defaults.

  ### [`~/.config/nvim/lua/user/nvim-tree.lua`](.config/nvim/lua/user/nvim-tree.lua)
  config file for [nvim-tree], a neovim file explorer written in lua, with icons.

  Opens on opening of any file, and auto-adjusts its window size.

  ### [`~/.config/nvim/lua/user/tree-sitter.lua`](.config/nvim/lua/user/tree-sitter.lua)
  config file for the nvim [tree-sitter] plugin, which helps with syntax highlighting of various languages.

  currently installing syntax for: "lua", "yaml", "bash", "hcl"

    <summary><code>offlineimap</code></summary>

  <blockquote>

  File: [`~/.config/offlineimap/config`](.config/offlineimap/config)

  This is to sync your email from whereever, but it's default configured for
  protonmail right now :) You will need to export the following env variables:

  (if using protonmail bridge, these should be the credentials from there)

  - `MAIL_SERVER` - normally 127.0.0.1 for protonmail
  - `MAIL_USER` - normally youruser@protonmail.com for protonmail
  - `MAIL_PASS` - normally generated from the protonmail bridge app
  - `MAIL_PORT` - typically 1143 for protonmail

  Currently we import ALL folders except the "All Mail" folder, which is just
  all the mail from all the other folders (including inbox, sent, trash, etc)

  <details>
    <summary><code>powerline</code></summary>

  <blockquote>

  Configuration files for [powerline], a status line for [BASH] and [tmux]. We enable a [spacechalk] color theme as well as:
  - local IP address
  - hostname
  - current working directory
  - git status info
  - unread mail count
  - kubernetes info
  - laptop battery information
  - the time
  - status of last run command (only appears if exit code is not 0)

  Currently working on getting mail notifications working.

    <summary><code>spotifyd</code></summary>

  <blockquote>

  Files:
  - [`~/.config/spotifyd/spotifyd.conf`](.config/spotifyd/spotifyd.conf)

  [spotifyd] is a spotify daemon used in combination with [spotify-tui] or
  other alternative spotify frontends.

  Current settings are for Linux only. I will add a macOS file and appropriate
  aliases and docs soon :)

  For Linux, this still requires a premium account, but then you can follow
  the potify-tui api connection instructions].


  (You also need to change your cache in spotifyd.conf to be your username)

  After that, just make sure you have your spotify credentials in bitwarden,
  and that you are logged into bitwarden via the [bw] cli. DON'T FORGET TO
  EXPORT YOUR SESSION ID! Then you HAVE TO RESTART SPOTIFYD!

  ```bash
  brew services restart spotifyd
  ```

  **Linux Note:** If you did a `brew install spotifyd`, then you might have to
  `brew edit spotifyd`, and then fix the hardcoded macOS backend to be `alsa`.
  Then you need to do a `brew reinstall --build-from-source spotifyd`.

  After that, you can use commands such as `spt` (spotify-tui) to launch a lightweight terminal frontend. You can follow spotify-tui's instructions above, but the most important part is going to be creating your own little spotify app which you can do after logging into the [developer spotify dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/).

  <blockquote>

  Configuration for [vim], a text editor, and it's plugins, installed via
  [vim-plug]. I am no longer actively using this vim configuration, and it will likely be archived soonish.

  [`~/.config/vim/vimrc`](.config/vim/vimrc) is the main file for the global vim configuration.
  We set a lot of defaults, including:
  - making vim use the [XDG Base Directory Spec]
  - setting window width to 82 characters
  - enabling line numbers
  - enabling highlighting of column cursor is on
  - add a colored column on column 80 for tidy python
  - sets a nerd font for vim
  - enable syntax highlighting
  - use [spacechalk] colorscheme
  - configure icons for VimDevicons, and NERDTree
  - ale icons changed, ale linters and fixers set for python
  - gitgutter icons
  - folding defaults
  - sets backups to XDG standard
  - allow backspace in insert mode
  - default tabbing
  - set search history
  - installs all the plugins [here](https://github.com/jessebot/dot_files/blob/main/.vimrc#L452)
  - uses template files below

  Auto-install vim-plug:
  - [`~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim`](.vim/autoload/plug.vim)

  Files for syntax highlighting for python, ssh_known_hosts, and .toml files:
  - [`~/.vim/syntax/python.vim`](.vim/syntax/python.vim)
  - [`~/.vim/syntax/ssh_known_hosts.vim`](.vim/syntax/ssh_known_hosts.vim)
  - [`~/.vim/syntax/toml.vim`](.vim/syntax/toml.vim)

  Files for default values in a python or markdown file:
  - [`~/.vim/templates/template.md`](.vim/templates/template.md)
  - [`~/.vim/templates/template.py`](.vim/templates/template.py)


  Since we install the [NERDTree](https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree) plugin,
  `:NERDTreeToggle` enables a directory tree of your current directory on the left hand side of your current vim window.

  - set default mailcap file for MIME types
  - always display images
  - set the default keymap file (for mapping keys)
  - quit without asking

  [`~/.config/w3m/keymap`](.config/w3m/keymap) sets vim key bindings.

Please feel free to fork this repo and make it your own.
You can still use `onboardme`, but you'll want to pass in _your_ git URL and branch. Example:

```bash
# this uses your personal git URL and makes sure to always pull from main
# if you want to overwrite your existing dot files, you can also add --overwrite to this command
onboardme --git_url https://github.com/your_username/dot_files --git_branch main
```

### RoadMap

- Get screenshots
- Sort out neovim idiosyncrasies to start using neovim full time
- migrate some of the themeing to a spacechalk org to unify it all
